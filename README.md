# The Budget App


This is a simple budget app build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The primary logic behind this application is through JavaScript.

## Planning:

### UI Module

* Add the new item to the UI
* Update the UI

## JavaScript concepts used:
* Module pattern
* Data Encapsulation 
* Separation of concerns 
* Event listeners 
* Data Structures/ Passing Data from one structure to another 
* DOM manipulation using insertAdjacentHTML
